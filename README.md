# GoodRoots-Groceries
GoodRoots Grocery Store is aimed at building an online, full-fledged grocery shopper using ASP.NET Core MVC. This would enable customers to browse for and purchase grocery items while the admin portal manages products, users, and orders. This project will illustrate the development of a web application from end to end by emphasizing ease in usability and responsiveness with safer authentication and efficient database management.
